Requirements
This package requires the packages "blas", "lapack" (without the "++"), and a Fortran compiler. 
On most Linuxes these are available as pre-compiled binaries under the name "blas" and "lapack". 
For SuSE 10.x, the Fortran compiler is available as package "gfortran". For SuSE 9.x, 
the Fortran compiler is available as package "gcc-g77".


Lapack Installation in Ubuntu
Using linux command line this can be done by typing the following commands:
sudo apt-get install libblas3gf
sudo apt-get install libblas-doc
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack3gf
sudo apt-get install liblapack-doc
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev


Introduction

There exists a rich variety of libraries for solving mathematical problems numerically in C++. The Netlib 
Repository is a good resource for information on this subject. The disadvantage of most of the 
libraries available there (like CLAPACK) is that they are outdated or at least not actively maintained.

Because of this, the project Lapack++ has been brought to life. It bases on lapack++, 
which would later evolve into TNT, which however was never truly released. Therefore the 
developer Christian Stimming {de} {en} came to the opinion that there should be something more 
up-to-date. Like many other mathematical libraries, Lapack++ bases on the two Fortran libraries BLAS 
and LAPACK which were converted from Fortran code to C code by a wrapper called f2c.

An alternative to Lapack++ is IT++. However, IT++ is licensed by the GPL. This may not be suitable 
for companies who do not wish to make the source code of ther projects freely available. In contrast to this 
Lapack++ is licensed by the LGPL and can therefore be used for non-open-source projects as well.

Installation

Dependencies

Prior to installing Lapack++, the following packages have to be installed:
    build-essential
    lapack3-dev
    refblas3-dev
    atlas3-base-dev (universe) 

By this the Fortran compiler g77 will be installed, too.


sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev libatlas-doc libatlas-test libatlas-base-dev 
libatlas3gf-base libatlas-cpp-0.6-dev libatlas-cpp-0.6-1 libatlas-cpp-0.6-1-dbg 

As other comments already indicate, your system has an ATLAS implementation of 
LAPACK. The correct order of library linking (for the non-threaded version of ATLAS) would be then:
-llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas





Compiling

In order to install the Lapack++ library, one has to compile it from source. The sources can be downloaded 
from this page. 

    the required download has a name of the form lapackpp-X.X.X.tar.gz
    untar the file and change into the newly created subfolder lapackpp-X.X.X
    compile and install Lapack++ with the usual commands ./configure , make and sudo make install 

Troubleshooting

If Lapack++ is installed to /usr/local (which is the default), the libraries will probably not be found:

./lapack: error while loading shared libraries: liblapackpp.so.1: 
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This can be resolved by editing (or creating) the file /etc/ld.so.conf in an editor with root 
privileges. One line with the installation path of the library

/usr/local/lib

has to be added to the file. After that, the environment variables for the library path have to 
be reloaded by entering the following command in a terminal:

sudo ldconfig
